Omnifood focus on promoting consumer well-being through healthy eating. Many people lead busy lives, balancing work, family, and other commitments, which often leaves little time for preparing meals. This can result in poor dietary choices and long-term health issues. Our solution leverages to address this problem. Through our app, users can input their dietary preferences and food likes and dislikes. But we donâ€™t stop there. We collaborate with restaurants and culinary partners to prepare and deliver the meals from these plans in select cities. All of this is available through a monthly subscription, where users can choose to receive either one or two meals per day, every day of the month.
